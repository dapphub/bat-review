# BAT Review

#### Nikolai Mushegian, DappHub

DISCLAIMER
---

This document is our best attempt to review the Solidity source code for TODO at commit [TODO](TODO). This is not a review of any smart contracts that have been deployed to the Ethereum blockchain.

It is important to note that no system is safe until proper verification tools exist. Solidity compiler errors are still common.

SCOPE
---

### No bytecode verification of any kind

We did not verify that any deployed bytecode matches any source files. It is also not yet feasible to verify that the compiler is correct and the output is valid.

### No incentive or business model analysis

We did not do any sort of incentive analysis.

### List of Files

#### Officially in scope

#### Not officially in scope, but had some feedback

#### Not reviewed


METHODOLOGY
---

Commit [TODO](TODO) was cloned and turned into a line-by-line review document, generating one Markdown file per Solidity file. These are available [on GitHub](TODO).
The results are summarized in this file.
